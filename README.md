# LGuard-codeXtreme25

# Project Desciption:
Our project is a smart IoT device called "L-Guard" that will be attached to motorcycle or bike helmets to improve on their functionality, with this smart IoT device the helmet will provide the following to the rider/user. 

In Rwanda Motorbike taxi is regarded as the fastest mean of transportation around the city so bikes take up a high majority of vehicle counts through out the city which has led them to become the most vulnerable when it comes to road accidents.

The problem taxi motorbikes in Rwanda have fatality rates, and also Accident response procedures take-up time. 
and we're building IoT system to streamlines and improve ride quality and safety for both the riders and their passengers.

1. Emergency alerts incase of accidents or simple put accident detection mechanisms.
where the system will alert near-by hospitals and police for timely help.
2. The helmet will collect and accidents data for the driver and upload/log it on our databases such as location of the accident, time.

3. QR code to provide insights to the passenger about the motorbike rider they are taking.
   QR code could also be used for online rider payments where it would show the riders Momo account details.

The following are some of the features of our software system provided to Our device customer/clients and potential stakeholders.
- Admin dashboard for (system management)
- graph to track user-records on accidents
- User Accident History
- User profile with [full_names, Email Address, Telephone, Driving Permit/License]
